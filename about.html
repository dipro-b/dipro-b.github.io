        <h1>about me</h1>

        <p>Hi! I'm Dipro Bhowmik, an aspiring economist & community organizer with a flair for data
analysis and development. My research interests are broadly in equity -- being
from Singapore and India, two former colonies, I am interested in how the legacy
of colonialism persists today, with a special focus on labor, health and housing
markets. </p>

<p> I graduated from Duke University in December 2017 and am currently interested in working at the intersection of software development, social justice, and research. Contact me if you need someone who can pair a programmer's work ethic with a thoughtful appraisal of a project's broader context. </p>
