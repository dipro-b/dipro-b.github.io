        <h1>about me</h1>

        <p>My name is dipro bhowmik, and i'm an aspiring economist with a flair
            for data analysis and development. My research interests are broadly in equity -- being from Singapore and India, two former colonies, I am interested in how the legacy of colonialism persists today, with a special focus on labor, health and housing markets. </p>
